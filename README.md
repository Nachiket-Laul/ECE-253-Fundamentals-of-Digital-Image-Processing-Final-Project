# ECE-253-Fundamentals-of-Digital-Image-Processing-Final-Project
ECE 253 course of UCSD final project, Old Photo Restoration and Enhancement

## 🔧 Installation

### Install Required Libraries
Open the VS Code terminal using **Ctrl + `** and run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy

## ▶️ Running the Code
As per the requirement run the Traditional_Pipeline_for_restoration_and_enhancement.py for a single image restoration and enhancement.

```bash
python Traditional_Pipeline_for_restoration_and_enhancement.py

If you wish to run and compare different methodologies proposed, run:

```bash
python Comparison_between_methodologies_for_traditional_pipeline.py

## 📝 Note

- Ensure the input image path is correctly specified in the script before execution for the Traditional_Pipeline_for_restoration_and_enhancement.py.
- Ensure the input image folder path name and output folder name is correctly specified in the script Comparison_between_methodologies_for_traditional_pipeline.py.
- The restoration quality depends on the level of degradation in the input image.
- Parameter values may need slight tuning for different photographs.
- For best results, use high-resolution scanned images.


Special Credits:
The GFPGAN is implemented using the the code in https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git which is also forked in our profile.

You can try implementing the GFPGAN first and then the traditional pipeline for better results.



## 🔧 Installation

### Install Required Libraries
Open the VS Code terminal using **Ctrl + `** and run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
▶️ Running the Code
Single Image Restoration and Enhancement
Run the following script for restoring and enhancing a single image:

bash
Copy code
python Traditional_Pipeline_for_restoration_and_enhancement.py
Comparison Between Different Methodologies
To run and compare the different methodologies proposed in the traditional pipeline, execute:

bash
Copy code
python Comparison_between_methodologies_for_traditional_pipeline.py
📝 Note
Ensure the input image path is correctly specified in
Traditional_Pipeline_for_restoration_and_enhancement.py

Ensure the input image folder path and output folder name are correctly specified in
Comparison_between_methodologies_for_traditional_pipeline.py

Restoration quality depends on the level of degradation in the input image.

Parameter values may require tuning for different photographs.

For best results, use high-resolution scanned images.
